# StudyMachan API — Explained Like You Are Five

Think of the app like a **restaurant kitchen**, and every request is a **note** the phone sends to the kitchen.
Each note has a **word at the front** that tells the kitchen what to do:

- `GET` = **"Show me something."** (just looking, nothing changes)
- `POST` = **"Please make something new."**
- `PUT` = **"Please change something."**

This page lists every note the kitchen understands, in plain words a 5-year-old can read.

---

## Is the kitchen open?

**Method:** `GET`
**Address:** `/`

The phone asks: _"Are you running?"_
The kitchen answers: **"Yes, StudyMachan Backend is running!"**

---

## Make a new account (Signup)

**Method:** `POST`
**Address:** `/auth/signup`
**Process name:** _Make a new account_

What the phone sends:

| What it sends | What it means                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `email`       | The person's email address                     |
| `password`    | A secret password (at least 8 letters/numbers) |
| `full_name`   | The person's name (optional)                   |
| `role`        | `student` or `tutor`                           |

What happens:

- The kitchen writes the account's ID.
- If a stronger email is needed, the kitchen says: **"you must click the link in your email first."** (`needs_email_confirmation = true`)
- If the email is already used: error `409` → **"This email already exists."**
- If the password is too easy: error `400` → **"Password is too weak."**

What the phone gets back: a message, the new account's ID, the email, and whether confirmation is needed.

## Open the door (Login)

**Method:** `POST`
**Address:** `/auth/login`
**Process name:** _Log in_

What the phone sends:

| What it sends | What it means              |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `email`       | The person's email address |
| `password`    | Their password             |

What happens:

- The kitchen checks with Supabase.
- If the email was never confirmed: error `403` → **"Please confirm your email address before signing in."**
- If the email or password is wrong: error `401` → **"Invalid email or password."**

What the phone gets back (when success): a login key (`access_token`), the user's ID, their email, and how many seconds the key lasts.

---

## Close the door (Logout)

**Method:** `POST`
**Address:** `/auth/logout`

---

## Show me my details

**Method:** `GET`
**Address:** `/auth/users/me` _(needs login key)_
**Process name:** _Who am I?_

The phone must send the login key in the header. The kitchen looks up the person and sends back:

- their ID,
- their email,
- their role (student/tutor),

- and when their account was made.

If the key is fake or missing: error `401` → **"not allowed."**

## I forgot my password

**Method:** `POST`
**Address:** `/auth/reset-password`
**Process name:** _Reset password_

The phone sends an email. The kitchen asks Supabase to mail that address a **"make a new password"** link.
